SOOO
this is gonna be a big mess to implement

Given a dictionary ( a list of definitions ), and a list of sentences ( a list of SentenceWord
                                                                        = (Regex, Option[Attribute]),
the function returns a trie looking like:
    Set[NodeWord]

A function, given a dictionary and a word, will return a list of NodeWord representing the possible replacements.
